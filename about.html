                We had a great time at this location. Let’s list: Pros:
                -Extremely clean. Hallways, rooms, pool, and lobby areas -Room
                was very modern and clean. Nicely decorated -Pool was a decent
                temperature for how hot it was! Bar staff, Spencer, Rick, Chuck,
                & BJ are a true asset to the Brightling Hotel brand. Honest,
                quick, and personable. My one and only con: There were no fresh
                make cookies left in the room at checking :). Other than that
                the Brightling Hotel was great. Thanks!
